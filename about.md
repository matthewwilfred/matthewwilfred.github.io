I'm Matthew and I'm an aspiring Data Scientist! After a stint as a business analyst and process chemist in the energy industry, I've decided to move into the burgeoning Data Science space in London. My portfolio of work can be found [here on my Github repo](https://github.com/matthewwilfred/Data-Science-Projects), where I use mainly Python, SQL and a variety of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to solve data problems.

You can find me most days on campus at General Assembly, London, in the Relay Building on top of Aldgate East station. I'm always up for a chat!

### More Information

Talk to me about Data Science, Machine Learning, and languages! I can speak Cantonese, Mandarin, some French and a wee bit of Spanish. My other interests include public speaking, which I'm practicing every fortnight with the Experience French Toastmasters group, and I love a good game of squash with my mates whenever I find the time.
