I'm Matthew and I'm a Data Science enthusiast! After a stint as a process chemist in the energy industry, I've decided to move into the burgeoning Data Science space in London. 

You can find me most days on campus at General Assembly, London, in the Relay Building on top of Aldgate East station.

### More Information

Talk to me about Data Science, Machine Learning, and languages! I can speak Cantonese, Mandarin, some French and a wee bit of Spanish. Feel free to talk German at me too, and I can nod along to pretend I understand.
