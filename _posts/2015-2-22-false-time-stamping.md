I wrote this on 18th October 2016, but timestamped it as 22nd February 2015. I wonder what it's going to show up as?

So in the last post I linked a preloaded image within the site's directory. Can I get it to link elsewhere?

Let's try with this image from Pinterest. I wonder if they allow hotlinking.
