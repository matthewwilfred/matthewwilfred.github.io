# synchronised interpretative trance paragliding

This is a post from the far future of 2046 where fishes fly, seas go dry and my latest Mac OS X update still won't-finish-god-damn-**why**-does-it-take-__forever__ 

Let's showcase some code.

		import csv
		with open('no-such-file.csv','r') as f:
		    reader = csv_reader(f)
		    listy = list(f)

I hope something breaks!
